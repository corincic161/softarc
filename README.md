# UpenUP(Open Unified Process)

OpenUP is a lean Unified Process that applies iterative and incremental approaches within a structured lifecycle. OpenUP embraces a pragmatic, agile philosophy that focuses on the collaborative nature of software development. It is a tools-agnostic, low-ceremony process that can be extended to address a broad variety of project types.  OpenUP is based on use
cases and scenarios, risk management, and an architecture-centric approach to drive
development.



* OpenUP principles

*Collaborate to align interests and share understanding.* This principle
promotes practices that foster a healthy team environment, enable collaboration
and develop a shared understanding of the project.

*Balance competing priorities to maximize stakeholder value.* This principle
promotes practices that allow project participants and stakeholders to develop a
solution that maximizes stakeholder benefits, and is compliant with constraints
placed on the project.

*Focus on the architecture early to minimize risks and organize development.*
This principle promotes practices that allow the team to focus on architecture to
minimize risks and organize development.

*Evolve to continuously obtain feedback and improve.* This principle promotes
practices that allow the team to get early and continuous feedback from
stakeholders, and demonstrate incremental value to them.


* How OpenUP is organized
OpenUP is organized in 2 different, correlated dimensions: method content and process
content. The method content is where method elements (namely roles, tasks, artifacts, and
guidance) are defined, regardless of how they are used in a project lifecycle. The process
content is where the method elements are applied in a temporal sense. 

* Project Life cicle

Uses an iterative, incremental lifecycle. 
Proper application of this lifecycle directly addresses the first core principle (Evolve).
The lifecycle is divided into 4 phases, each with a particular purpose and milestone criteria to exit the phase:  

*Inception:* To understand the problem. 

*Elaboration:* To validate the solution architecture. 

*Construction:* To build and verify the solution in increments. 

*Transition:* To transition the solution to the operational environment and validate the solution. 

OpenUP targets small and colocated teams interested in agile and iterative development. Small projects constitute teams of 3 to 6 people and involve 3 to 6 months of development.

* Iteration Lifecycle: 

1. Phases are further decomposed into a number of iterations. 

2. At the end of each iteration a verified build of the system increment is available.  

3. Each iteration has its own lifecycle, beginning with planning and ending in a stable system increment, Iteration Review (did we achieve the iteration objectives) and a Retrospective (is there a better process).  

4. Progress on completion of micro-increments is monitored daily via “Scrums” and the iteration burndown chart to provide timely feedback.

* OpenUP roles:

*Stakeholder* represents interest groups whose needs must be satisfied by the
project. It is a role that may be played by anyone who is (or potentially will be)
materially affected by the outcome of the project

*Analyst* represents customer and end-user concerns by gathering input from
stakeholders to understand the problem to be solved and by capturing and setting
priorities for requirements.

*Architect* is responsible for designing the software architecture, which includes
making the key technical decisions that constrain the overall design and
implementation of the project.

*Developer* is responsible for developing a part of the system, including designing
it to fit into the architecture, and then implementing, unit-testing, and integrating
the components that are part of the solution.

*Tester* is responsible for the core activities of the test effort, such as identifying,
defining, implementing, and conducting the necessary tests, as well as logging the
outcomes of the testing and analyzing the results.

*Project Manager* leads the planning of the project in collaboration with
stakeholders and team, coordinates interactions with the stakeholders, and keeps
the project team focused on meeting the project objectives.

*Any Role* represents anyone on the team that can perform general tasks.

* Tasks - A task is unit of work a role may be asked to perform. In OpenUP, there are 18 tasks that
the roles perform either as primary performers or additional performers.

* Artifacts - An artifact is something that is produced, modified, or used by a task. Roles are
responsible for creating and updating artifacts. Artifacts are subject to version control
throughout the project lifecycle.

* Process 

Reusable method content is created separately from its application in processes. Method
content provides step-by-step explanations, describing how specific development goals
are achieved independent of the placement of method elements within a development
lifecycle.

Processes take these method elements and relate them into semi-ordered sequences that
are customized to specific types of projects. Method elements are organized into reusable
pieces of process called capability patterns, providing a consistent development approach
to common project needs. These patterns are made from organizing tasks (from the
method content) into activities, grouping them in a sequence that makes sense for the
particular area where that pattern is applied.
