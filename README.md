# UpenUP(Open Unified Process)

OpenUP is a lean Unified Process that applies iterative and incremental approaches within a structured lifecycle. OpenUP embraces a pragmatic, agile philosophy that focuses on the collaborative nature of software development. It is a tools-agnostic, low-ceremony process that can be extended to address a broad variety of project types.  OpenUP is based on use
cases and scenarios, risk management, and an architecture-centric approach to drive
development.



* OpenUP principles
*Collaborate to align interests and share understanding.* This principle
promotes practices that foster a healthy team environment, enable collaboration
and develop a shared understanding of the project.
*Balance competing priorities to maximize stakeholder value. * This principle
promotes practices that allow project participants and stakeholders to develop a
solution that maximizes stakeholder benefits, and is compliant with constraints
placed on the project.
*Focus on the architecture early to minimize risks and organize development.*
This principle promotes practices that allow the team to focus on architecture to
minimize risks and organize development.
*Evolve to continuously obtain feedback and improve. * This principle promotes
practices that allow the team to get early and continuous feedback from
stakeholders, and demonstrate incremental value to them.

* How OpenUP is organized
OpenUP is organized in 2 different, correlated dimensions: method content and process
content. The method content is where method elements (namely roles, tasks, artifacts, and
guidance) are defined, regardless of how they are used in a project lifecycle. The process
content is where the method elements are applied in a temporal sense. Many different
lifecycles for different project types can be created from the same set of method elements
(more details are on Process section below).

* Project Life cicle
Uses an iterative, incremental lifecycle. 
Proper application of this lifecycle directly addresses the first core principle (Evolve).
The lifecycle is divided into 4 phases, each with a particular purpose and milestone criteria to exit the phase:  

*Inception:* To understand the problem. 

*Elaboration:* To validate the solution architecture. 

*Construction:* To build and verify the solution in increments. 

*Transition:* To transition the solution to the operational environment and validate the solution. 

OpenUP targets small and colocated teams interested in agile and iterative development. Small projects constitute teams of 3 to 6 people and involve 3 to 6 months of development. 

* Iteration Lifecycle: 
** Phases are further decomposed into a number of iterations. 

** At the end of each iteration a verified build of the system increment is available.  

** Each iteration has its own lifecycle, beginning with planning and ending in a stable system increment, Iteration Review (did we achieve the iteration objectives) and a Retrospective (is there a better process).  

** Progress on completion of micro-increments is monitored daily via “Scrums” and the iteration burndown chart to provide timely feedback.
